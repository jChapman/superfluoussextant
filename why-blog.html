<p>I thought it would be interesting to share how I decided to create this blog since it was (I think) interesting.</p>
<p>I first became interested in blogging after listening to the <a class="reference external" href="http://podcastinit.com/static-site-generators.html">__Init__ podcast about static site generators</a>.
After that I took a look at both <a class="reference external" href="http://getpelican.com">Pelican</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://getnikola.com">Nikola</a> even going so far as to download both of them and make a page with each.
I decided that I would prefer to write my blog with reStructured text, after being burned by markdown (which flavor?).</p>
<p>After looking into both static site generators, I stopped for a while until I listened to <a class="reference external" href="https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/69/write-an-excellent-programming-blog">Talk Python to Me podcast about writing a blog</a>.
This further encouraged me to write a blog and I finally took the time to chose between Nikola and Pelican, in the end I really just decided to pick one to get over <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis">analysis paralysis</a> and actually do something (I ended up going with pelican).
I then wrote some pointless test posts and started looking for a theme, because I didn't like the default one. The resulted in more analysis paralysis, again I just picked one in order to move on (my current theme is <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/hmleal/ninja-theme">ninja-theme by hmleal</a> it looks great and is based on <a class="reference external" href="http://getskeleton.com/">skeleton css</a>)</p>
<p>After overcoming two pointless decisions (I relatively painlessly switch to Nikola and switch themes), I bought a domain through google (who knew they sold domains!) and still had no content.
It wasn't until today that I got the motivation to write actual content for the blog after listening to another excellent <a class="reference external" href="https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/71/soft-skills-the-software-developer-s-life-manual">TalkPython podcast, this one about soft skills</a>.
So now I'm here, I have (some) actual content, and I have (some) motivation to keep writing, who knows what will come next?</p>
