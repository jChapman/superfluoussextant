What is this blog? What do I want it to be? How can it help others? Why will others read it? Why will they find it useful?


The most helpful blogs that I've read can be put into two categories:
    1. Those that show problems or tutorials around things that I have been working with
    2. Those that have commentary on topics I find interesting


To me this is the purpose of this blog:
    * A place to share my thoughts, even if they are (likely) stupid
    * A place to share frustrations and any work-arounds I find for them
    * A place to help others who want to do similar things to what I'm doing

So... here goes nothing!
