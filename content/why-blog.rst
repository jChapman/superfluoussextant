I thought it would be interesting to share how I decided to create this blog since it was (I think) interesting.

I first became interested in blogging after listening to the `__Init__ podcast about static site generators <http://podcastinit.com/static-site-generators.html>`_. 
After that I took a look at both `Pelican <http://getpelican.com>`_ and `Nikola <https://getnikola.com>`_ even going so far as to download both of them and make a page with each.
I decided that I would prefer to write my blog with reStructured text, after being burned by markdown (which flavor?).

After looking into both static site generators, I stopped for a while until I listened to `Talk Python to Me podcast about writing a blog <https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/69/write-an-excellent-programming-bloghttps://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/69/write-an-excellent-programming-blog>`_.
This further encouraged me to write a blog and I finally took the time to chose between Nikola and Pelican, in the end I really just decided to pick one to get over `analysis paralysis <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis>`_ and actually do something (I ended up going with pelican).
I then wrote some pointless test posts and started looking for a theme, because I didn't like the default one. The resulted in more analysis paralysis, again I just picked one in order to move on (my current theme is `ninja-theme by hmleal <https://github.com/hmleal/ninja-theme>`_ it looks great and is based on `skeleton css <http://getskeleton.com/>`_)

After overcoming two pointless decisions (I relatively painlessly switch to Nikola and switch themes), I bought a domain through google (who knew they sold domains!) and still had no content.
It wasn't until today that I got the motivation to write actual content for the blog after listening to another excellent `TalkPython podcast, this one about soft skills <https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/71/soft-skills-the-software-developer-s-life-manual>`_. 
So now I'm here, I have (some) actual content, and I have (some) motivation to keep writing, who knows what will come next?
