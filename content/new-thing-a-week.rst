In an effort to expand my skills and to just try some new cool stuff I'm going to try and complete a different project every week until the end of this year.
I want each project to be something I have never done before. Even if I may have dabbled in the subject before (and I do like to dabble), I'm terrible at finishing things.

Criteria for a "thing"

    * Must be finishable in a week
    * Must have a actual product associated with the "thing" (be it physical or digital)
    * Must be something I have never completed before


Here's what I'm thinking of

    * Create a logo
    * Make something with an arduino
    * Make a game (in a new language?)
    * Make some physical things
    * Simulation gif like those found at https://www.reddit.com/r/simulated
    * Animate a short clip
    * Paint something

Without further ado, `here is the first week's thing <http://superfluoussextant.com/robot-logo.html>`_
